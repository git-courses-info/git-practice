# git-practice

A repo to practice git
Let's say this is the starting point of a new app, that footios and fotistsakiris are going to implement together.
In order to achive this, i.e. play the roll for two different devs. I cloned the repo in two different places
and I will start commiting changes in each cloned project, after I change the personal settings in `git config --global -e`.

**Let the game begin!**

Note: The maintainer of this repo is going to be `footios` and `fotiostsakirs` will be the collaborator.

- (fotistsakiris) OK, may I please have my first assignment?
